            "me": "Cardano-TH is an efficient and secure Stake Pool allowing you to easily participate in the functioning of the Cardano blockchain. Since Cardano is a Proof Of Stake blockchain, anyone who owns ADAs can participate in securing the blockchain. As a reward, he will receive remuneration in ADAs. But to participate, you must leave a computer on 24/7 and it is neither practical nor cheap ... This is where the Stake Pools come in: you safely delegate your right to participate in the functionning of the blockchain. (You do not send your ADAs but a certificate). In exchange for this service, the Stake Pool withholds part of your winnings. With Cardano-TH, you keep more than 99.99% of your earnings.",
